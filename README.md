# Publishing
 
The scripts and tools in this repository automate the publishing of artifacts for 
the Spine Event Engine libraries.

The libraries that are being published are Git submodules to the Publishing Git repository.

## Requirements

### Kotlin DSL

Only Gradle projects using the Kotlin DSL are supported.

### Version file format

This application expects the libraries to define their `version.gradle.kts` in a consistent fashion.
Version files must declare the version of the library itself and the version of its dependencies
using Kotlin expressions like so:

```kotlin
val coreJava = "5.0.51"     // OK
val base = "5.0.50"         // OK

val time: String = "5.0.51" // Not OK, no need for the type.
var gcloudJava = "5.0.51"   // Not OK, needs to be a constant.

```  

This application also expects consistent naming:

- "coreJava" for the [core-java](https://github.com/SpineEventEngine/core-java) library;
- "base" for the [base](https://github.com/SpineEventEngine/base) library;
- "time" for the [time](https://github.com/SpineEventEngine/time) library.

To extend this, go to `io.spine.publishing.SpineLibrary` and add values to the `SpineLibrary` enum.

### Gradle tasks

Each library needs to define a `publish` Gradle task. This task is used for publishing the artifacts
to the remote artifact repository.

### Travis token

As `publishing` is triggered via Travis REST API, libraries that wish to trigger publishing must
be able to trigger builds. They can use a script 
from config: `config/scripts/trigger-publishing.sh`. This script relies on the 
`TRAVIS_TOKEN` env variable. To get the token:

1) run `travis login --com` and complete the login process; 
2) run `travis token`;
3) set the value of the token to the `TRAVIS_TOKEN` env variable in the settings of your Travis 
repository.

#### Known issues

Sometimes, especially if you have used `travis login` before, Travis CLI tool uses an old
`https://api.travis-ci.org` API URL. `https://api.travis-ci.com` must be used instead. If you
run into problems, check your `~/.travis/config.yml` file for mentions 
of `https://api.travis-ci.org` and change them to `https://api.travis-ci.com`.
