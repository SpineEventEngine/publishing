     * Goes through each library, building them to ensure that the dependencies are consistent.

     * For example:
     *
     *          A --------------> B
     *           \               /
     *            --------> C <--
     *
     * library A depends on library B and C. Library B depends on library C.
     * In such a configuration, the following happens:
     *
     * 1) C is built;
     * 2) C is published to the local Maven repo, so that it can be used for further builds;
     * 3) B is built;
     * 4) B is published to the local Maven repo;
     * 5) A is built;
     * 6) A is published to the local Maven repo;
     *
     * Returns [Ok] if all of the libraries are built successfully. Returns [Error] if a library
     * could not be built or published to the local Maven repo.
     *
     * All of the libraries are built without checking the version increment. The builds are
     * performed to check whether the library is valid, thus, the version increment check is
     * redundant.
