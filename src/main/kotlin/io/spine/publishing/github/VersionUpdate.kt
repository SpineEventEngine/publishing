 *
 * To update the version, the following Git commands are returned:
 *
 * 1) the `master` branch is checked out, as the version change is a direct `master` push;
 * 2) the `version.gradle.kts` file is staged for commit. It is expected that this file has already
 * been changed to have the correct version;
 * 3) the commit is performed;
 * 4) the local `master` branch is pushed to the respective remote repository.
 *
 * @param library the library that has its version updated
 * @param provider the provider of the credentials to use to authorize the version update
